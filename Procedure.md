# Software Development Procedure

## Inputs

- **Funding:**
  - Ensure budget allocation for software tools, personnel, and resources.

- **High-level Milestones:**
  - Define key project phases and deliverables.
  - Set deadlines for each milestone.
  - Outlines the overall functionalities and objectives(developers, testers, product owners) of the software.

- **Staffing:**
  - Assign roles such as developers, testers, and project managers.
  - Ensure the team has necessary skills and experience.

## Procedure

### 1. Plan a Project Backlog

- **Requirements Gathering:**
  - Conduct meetings with stakeholders to gather feature requirements.
  - Prioritize features based on business value and feasibility.

- **Tools:**
  - Using such kind of project management tools to manage the backlog.
  - Version Control System (e.g., Git): Facilitates code versioning, collaboration, and branching for development.
  - Code Review Tool (e.g., GitLab Reviews, GitHub Pull Requests): Streamlines code review process with features like commenting, highlighting changes, and merging code.
  - Unit Testing Framework (e.g., JUnit, Jest): Provides tools for developers to write and execute automated tests for individual code units.

- **Team Involvement:**
  - Hold regular backlog refinement sessions with the entire team.
  - Daily Stand-up Meeting (15 Minutes): Each team member shares progress on assigned tasks, identifies roadblocks, and seeks help if needed using video conferencing tools or a communication platform within the project management tool.
  - Selects a set of user stories for the upcoming sprint considering effort and capacity.

### 2. Execute with Agile Methodology

- **Agile Framework:**
  - Implement Scrum with two-week sprint cycles.
  - The specific agile methodology used (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) can be chosen based on project needs. This procedure provides a general framework.

- **Sprint Planning:**
  - Define sprint goals and select backlog items for each sprint.
  - Allocate tasks based on team capacity and skills.
  - A sprint backlog with specific user stories assigned to team members within the project management tool.

- **Daily Stand-ups:**
  - Conduct brief daily meetings to update on progress and address blockers.

- **Sprint Review:**
  - Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.

- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Reflect on the sprint to identify and implement improvements.

### 3. Archive Design Documentation

- **Documentation Standards:**
  - Create comprehensive design documents detailing architecture and features.

- **Tools:**
  - Use Confluence or SharePoint for storing and organizing documentation.

- **Retention Period:**
  - Keep documents archived for a minimum of five years for future reference.

### 4. Perform Design Reviews

- **Review Process:**
  - Schedule design review meetings with at least two peers and one senior engineer.
  - Review designs for alignment with requirements and best practices.

### 5. Perform Code Reviews

- **Review Process:**
  - Use platforms like GitHub or GitLab for code review.
  - Require at least two team members to approve code before merging.

- **Focus Areas:**
  - Ensure code quality, functionality, security, and adherence to standards.

### 6. Archive and Perform Test Plan

- **Test Plan Development:**
  - Develop a comprehensive test plan including unit, integration, and system tests.

- **Testing Tools:**
  - Utilize Jenkins for continuous integration and Selenium for automated testing.

- **Quality Assurance:**
  - Conduct thorough testing and perform regression testing before release.

- **Archiving:**
  - Store test results and documentation alongside design documentation.

## Outputs

- **Finished Software:**
  - Deliver the completed software product to stakeholders.

- **Test Plan:**
  - Provide detailed documentation of the testing strategy and results.

- **Design Documentation:**
  - Ensure all design documents are complete and archived for future reference.

## Conclusion
- At least two team members should participate in each code review using the code review tool.
- This procedure provides a clear roadmap for developing software using agile practices. By adhering to these steps, the team will ensure high-quality deliverables and maintain a structured development process.
